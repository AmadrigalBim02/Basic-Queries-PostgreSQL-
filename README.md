### README: PostgreSQL Car Inventory Management Script

#### **Overview**
This Python script demonstrates how to use the `psycopg2` library to manage a PostgreSQL database. It includes operations to create, insert, query, update, and delete records in a `car_inventory` table. The script is designed for educational purposes and can be easily extended for real-world applications.

Additionally, the folder containing this script will be uploaded to Try It. It includes an image captured from a PostgreSQL database tool, illustrating how the `car_inventory` table is created and displayed in the database.

#### **Key Features**
1. **Database Connection**:
   - Establishes a connection to the PostgreSQL database using `psycopg2`.
   - Connects to the `postgres` database with user credentials.

2. **Table Creation**:
   - Creates the `car_inventory` table with the following schema:
     - `id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each car.
     - `brand`: The brand name (e.g., Tesla, Honda).
     - `year`: The manufacturing year.
     - `module`: The car's model/type (e.g., Hatchback, Sedan).

3. **Data Insertion**:
   - Inserts five predefined car records into the table.
   - Avoids duplicate entries with the `ON CONFLICT` clause.

4. **Query Operations**:
   - Fetches all cars or filtered subsets of cars based on specific criteria:
     - Cars manufactured in or after 2010.
     - Cars not of a specific type (e.g., not Hatchbacks).
     - Cars from specific brands like Tesla or BMW.
   - Supports data sorting by year or brand.
   - Counts the total number of cars and groups them by type.

5. **Update Operations**:
   - Updates Tesla's `module` to `Sedan`.
   - Increments the manufacturing year for all cars by 1.

6. **Delete Operations**:
   - Deletes cars older than 2010.
   - Removes all records of cars from specific brands (e.g., BMW).

7. **Advanced Queries**:
   - Categorizes cars as 'Old' or 'New' based on the year.
   - Converts car data into JSON format for structured representation.
   - Identifies the `module` type with the highest number of cars.

8. **Temporary Table**:
   - Demonstrates how to create and query a temporary table for cars manufactured after 2010.

9. **Pagination**:
   - Fetches data in chunks using `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`.

10. **Integration with Database Tool**:
    - A screenshot from the PostgreSQL database tool is included in the folder, showcasing:
      - The table structure.
      - Example data inserted into the table.
      - Query results visible directly within the tool.

#### **Folder Contents**
1. **Python Script**:
   - The script file (e.g., `car_inventory.py`) contains the full implementation.

2. **Database Screenshot**:
   - An image from a PostgreSQL database management tool (e.g., pgAdmin) that:
     - Shows the `car_inventory` table.
     - Displays data stored in the table.
     - Confirms the table creation and data operations.

3. **README File**:
   - This documentation to explain the script and folder contents.

#### **How to Use**
1. **Pre-Requisites**:
   - PostgreSQL must be installed and running.
   - Install the `psycopg2` library:
     ```bash
     pip install psycopg2
     ```

2. **Run the Script**:
   - Save the script file and execute it:
     ```bash
     python car_inventory.py
     ```

3. **Verify in PostgreSQL Tool**:
   - Open your PostgreSQL tool (e.g., pgAdmin).
   - Navigate to the `car_inventory` table to confirm its structure and data.
   - Use the screenshot included in the folder as a reference for the expected output.

---

#### **Visualization in Database Tool**
- The included image provides a visual representation of:
  - How the `car_inventory` table looks in a PostgreSQL GUI tool.
  - Data records and their structure for better understanding.
  - Query results, as seen directly within the database tool.

This script, along with the uploaded folder and database screenshot, serves as a practical demonstration of managing relational databases with Python and PostgreSQL.
